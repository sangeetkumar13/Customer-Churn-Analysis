# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis
Data analysis project to identify key factors contributing to customer churn using Python and EDA techniques.

This project explores the factors influencing customer churn using a real-world dataset. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and actionable business insights to support churn reduction strategies.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset contains information on customer demographics, account details, services subscribed, and churn status. Features include:
- Contract Type
- Tenure
- Monthly and Total Charges
- Payment Method
- Internet & Streaming Services
- Demographic info (gender, senior citizen, partner status)

## 🔍 EDA Highlights
- Churn is higher among customers with:
  - Month-to-month contracts
  - Short tenure
  - Electronic check payments
  - Fewer value-added services (e.g., tech support)
- Customers with longer contracts and bundled services show greater loyalty.

## 📌 Key Insights
- Early-stage customers require better onboarding/engagement.
- Offering discounts or incentives for long-term contracts could reduce churn.
- Targeted interventions for high-risk groups (identified via patterns) can improve retention.

## 🧠 Next Steps
- Build a churn prediction model using classification algorithms.
- Develop interactive dashboards to monitor churn trends.
- Apply cohort and lifetime value analysis for deeper segmentation.
